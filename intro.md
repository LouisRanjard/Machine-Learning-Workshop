# Introduction to machine learning

## What is machine learning?

Traditionally, programming has involved writing code as a series of formal steps the program should take when trying to achieve a certain goal. The problem with this is that when you have a large and complicated dataset, it can be extremely difficult to describe the rules the program should use to solve your problem.

This is where machine learning comes into play. Machine learning allows you to write a program that learns and looks for patterns within the data you expose it to. There are two main types of machine learning:

### Supervised
Supervised learning occurs when you have a dataset and a set of labels describing the data that you can train the computer with. An example of this would be a library of images of cells which have been labelled as cancerous and non-cancerous.

### Unsupervised
Unsupervised learning occurs when you have a dataset without any labels and you wish to look at the patterns within the data.
